### Generic Focuses ###
generic_army_effort:0 "현대 전투"
generic_army_effort_desc:0 "대전쟁은 나폴레옹시대의 전쟁을 완전히 끝내고, 마침내 소총, 기관총, 대포와 같은 무기들을 쓰이게 함으로써 영원히 전쟁을 변화시켰습니다. 우리 군대는 말 그대로 적응하거나 사라져야 합니다."
generic_equipment_effort:0 "장비 현대화"
generic_equipment_effort_desc:0 "오랜시간동안 군사적 돌파는 느렸고, 볼트액션 소총을 가지고 있으면 충분했습니다. 하지만 19세기의 소총들은 전후 전쟁터에서는 전혀 어울리지 않습니다. 우리는 현재에 안주하지 않고 새로운 장비를 갖추어야 합니다."
generic_motorization_effort:0 "육군 차량화"
generic_motorization_effort_desc:0 "기병대는 대전쟁에서 마지막으로 사용되었을 것입니다. 트럭은 더 이상 단순한 운송 도구가 아니며, 빠르게 기동전에 통합되었습니다. 우리는 낡은 사고를 떨쳐버리고 우리의 공격과 증원 속도를 높이기 위하여 자동차를 사용해야 합니다."
generic_doctrine_effort:0 "대전쟁에서의 교훈"
generic_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "우리는 대전에서 무엇을 배웠을까요? 불과 5년동안의 전쟁속에서 수많은 군인들이 우리에게 새로운 전쟁의 역동성을 가르쳐주기 위하여 목숨을 잃었습니다. 만약 우리가 그들을 통해서 배우지 않는다면, 우리 군인들은 전쟁터에서 똑같은 운명을 맞이하게 될 것입니다."
generic_equipment_effort_2:0 "장비 연구"
generic_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "장비를 현대화하는 것은 따라잡았을지 모르지만, 새로운 설계는 이미 우리의 것을 쓸모없게 만들고 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 인내해야 하며, 장비에 있어서 한치도 뒤쳐지지 않도록 해야 합니다. 이것은 우리가 우리만의 설계를 개발해야 한다는 것을 의미 합니다."
generic_mechanization_effort:0 "기계화 전투"
generic_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "트럭은 전선에서는 별로 좋은 성과를 내지 못했지만, 이제 트럭과 전차의 중간정도를 만날수 있을것 같습니다. 기갑화된 개인 수송차량은 병력을 직접 전투에 투입할수 있고, 화재로부터 방어할 수 있으며, 필요한 경우 강력한 화력지원까지 제공할 수 있습니다."
generic_doctrine_effort_2:0 "군사 훈련"
generic_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "모든 힘은 훈련을 필요로 하고, 우리도 마찬가지 입니다. 기동 훈련은 장군들에게 오락 이상의 것으로, 수많은 생명을 낭비하지 않고 전술을 시험할 수 있도록 해줍니다. 이로써 우리는 이론적인 전술을 완성할 수 있게 될 것입니다."
generic_doctrine_effort_3:0 "기동 훈련"
generic_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "전쟁을 '미리' 시험함으로써 우리는 실제로 전쟁하지 않고도 전쟁과 같은 시나리오를 시험할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 우리 장교들은 군사 전술적 측면에서 신선함을 느낄수 있을 것입니다."
generic_equipment_effort_3:0 "혁신적인 장비"
generic_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "우리는 첨단 군사장비를 얻기 위해 외국의 장비를 구입하거나 따라잡는 것에 국한되지 않고 새로운 혁신을 보여야 합니다. 강대국들조차도 우리의 군인들에게 곧 어떤 무기가 잡히게 될지 놀라게 될 것입니다."
generic_armor_effort:0 "기갑 전투"
generic_armor_effort_desc:0 "전차는 현대전의 꽃으로, 대포로 무장하고 일반 소총에는 영향을 받지않는 이동식 차량입니다. 우리가 적은 양만을 생산하더라도, 우리는 이 철로 만들어진 거대한 짐승을 이용하여 적을 뚫고 나갈 것입니다."
generic_special_forces:0 "특수부대"
generic_special_forces_desc:0 "특수부대는 정예부대보다 오래되었습니다. 현대적 장비를 갖춘다면 징집된 병사라도 전장에서 자신을 지킬수 있습니다. 하지만 어떤 상황들은 너무나 우리에게 적대적이라서 특별 훈련을 받은 사람들이 필요합니다. 산악부대, 해병대, 공수부대가 대표적인 예시입니다."
generic_soldier_effort:0 "병사 우선순위 지정"
generic_soldier_effort_desc:0 "병사는 어느 군대에서든지 핵심입니다. 우리가 장교대신 병사들에게 초점을 맞추는 것은 당연합니다."
generic_officer_effort:0 "장교 우선순위 지정"
generic_officer_effort_desc:0 "따르는 이가 있고, 이끄는 이가 있습니다. 이끄는 이가 없으면 어떻게 되겠습니까? 따르는 이들중 하나가 어떻게 해야하는지도 모르는채 다른 이들을 이끌어야 할 것입니다. 그런일은 절대 용납될수 없습니다. 우리는 장교들이 이끌수 있도록 해야 합니다."
generic_arms_imports:0 "무기 수입"
generic_arms_imports_desc:0 "우리의 군 장비에 대한 지원이 필요한데, 어디서 무기를 수입해야 할까요?"
generic_recruitment:0 "군인 미화"
generic_recruitment_desc:0 "사람들이 군대를 멀리하는 이유는 너무 적은 이익에 비하여 많은 고통이 있다고 생각하기 때문입니다. 우리는 군인에 대한 열정이 사람들을 열광하게 하고, 그들이 군대를 외면하지 않을 정도로 군인들을 미화해야 합니다."
generic_reform_officer_corps:0 "장교단 개편"
generic_reform_officer_corps_desc:0 "이렇게 급변하는 전쟁의 시기에, 우리는 장교단이 완전히 최신식 전술을 사용하도록 해야 합니다."
generic_reform_supply_lines:0 "현대적 보급선"
generic_reform_supply_lines_desc:0 "말로 보급선을 유지하는 시대는 끝났습니다. 우리는 보급 운송에서 얻을수 있는 모든 수단을 사용해야 합니다. 현재의 시스템보다 효율이 높은 트럭과 비행기를 사용할 것입니다."
generic_national_training_school:0 "국가 사관학교"
generic_national_training_school_desc:0 "국가 사관학교를 설립하여 우리의 장교들이 최고의 훈련을 받을수 있도록 할수 있습니다."
generic_mil_industrial_complex:0 "군수산업시설"
generic_mil_industrial_complex_desc:0 "알려진 모든 항공법칙에 따르면, 벌이 날수있는 방법은 없습니다. 벌의 날개는 너무 작아서 땅에서 벗어날수 없다고 합니다. 물론 벌은 불가능하다고 생각하는 것을 신경쓰지 않고 그냥 날아갑니다."

generic_aviation_effort:0 "공군"
generic_aviation_effort_tt:0 "§Y공군기지§!의 슬롯이 부족합니다."
generic_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Great War. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Airforce to organise them."
generic_fighter_focus:0 "공중 우세"
generic_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The dogfights of the Great War were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."
generic_bomber_focus:0 "전략 폭격"
generic_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Great War fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."
generic_aviation_effort_2:0 "현대 항공 전술"
generic_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the airforce is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
generic_CAS_effort:0 "근접 항공 지원"
generic_CAS_effort_desc:0 "While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat."
generic_rocket_effort:0 "실험적 로켓"
generic_rocket_effort_desc:0 "The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting."
generic_NAV_effort:0 "해군 항공"
generic_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."

generic_naval_effort:0 "현대식 조선소"
generic_naval_effort_tt:0 "§Y해군기지§!의 슬롯이 부족합니다."
generic_naval_effort_desc:0 "If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet."
generic_flexible_navy:0 "유연한 전술"
generic_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreck havoc."
generic_large_navy:0 "전력 투영"
generic_large_navy_desc:0 "Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is in our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies."
generic_submarine_effort:0 "잠수함전"
generic_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships."
generic_cruiser_effort:0 "보조함"
generic_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats."
generic_destroyer_effort:0 "대잠전"
generic_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently."
generic_capital_ships_effort:0 "주력함"
generic_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance."

generic_industrial_effort:0 "산업 체계"
generic_industrial_effort_desc:0 "To construct a large industrial base, we will need to set up the basics of modern industry, and maybe even make initial choices. Concentrated or dispersed industrial centres, investing in machine tools and construction tools. All of those are important things to focus on."
generic_construction_effort:0 "산업 보조금"
generic_construction_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YCivilian Factories§!"
generic_construction_effort_desc:0 "A healthy and strong industry doesn't just appear out of nowhere. While we may have to start more ambitious projects later, we must start by ensuring that those with good management skills can start healthy, successful companies that may later grow into giants."
generic_production_effort:0 "국가 병기창"
generic_production_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YMilitary Factory§!"
generic_production_effort_desc:0 "Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army. Their goal is quite modest, procuring the gear our army needs using state funds, civilian production and simple production, but it is better than not getting any new rifles."
generic_construction_effort_2:0 "산업 중심지"
generic_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Entrepreneurship is one thing, but to have an economy worthy of even a regional power, we will need to foster the large industrial regions that made the Industrial Revolution. The seeds of such regions are large investment into promising industrial sites."
generic_production_effort_2:0 "군사 제조업"
generic_production_effort_2_desc:0 "We must produce our own military equipment if we want our army to be more than a reserve force. The only way to do so is to heavily fund the creation of dedicated military manufactures, and support them with regular contracts and promises to ensure they can stay afloat."
generic_production_effort_3:0 "군수 산업"
generic_production_effort_3_desc:0 "We have finally reached a point where we have companies able to build the equipment we need, even if their output is still limited. However, our needs are still great, and by giving them absolute support over foreign companies they will slowly scale up to our needs."
generic_infrastructure_effort:0 "국가 기반시설"
generic_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Our growing industry requires a solid infrastructure to ensure the transit of goods. We need to do away with chaotic, city to city planning and finally draw the roads of our country. Those who exist, those who will be expanded or linked, and those that have yet to be."
generic_infrastructure_effort_tt:0 "§Y기반시설§!의 슬롯이 부족합니다."
generic_synth_oil_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YSynthetic Refinery§!"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "철도망"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "Modern countries need railway networks, able to bring anything from one point of the country to another rapidly and efficiently. This means we will have to expand our railways and create junctions that didn't occur to us even a few years ago."
generic_construction_effort_3:0 "산업망"
generic_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Much like roads and railways, industries are connected in large, sprawling networks, based on input and output, import and export. As our infrastructure improves, so do these links, and our industry grows stronger as they can rely on the economy of our few wealthy provinces."

generic_extra_tech_slot:0 "연구 협회"
generic_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on, until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes."
generic_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "연구소"
generic_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "As our industrial base expands, we finally go from just manufacturing to actually designing and creating, or at least attracting those who do. Those research institutes have not only the minds, but also the funds to make discoveries. Let us waste no time encouraging their implantation."
generic_technology_sharing:0 "기술공유"
generic_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime research and development more efficiently. Of course, we will need to prove our help is impactful to them, but once this much is proved, we stand to benefit greatly from their research."
generic_secret_weapons:0 "비밀무기"
generic_secret_weapons_desc:0 "It is tempting to expend all extra resources into just developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research. Just because we are not a major power, does not mean we cannot make our own strides in those fields."

generic_political_effort:0 "정치 개혁"
generic_political_effort_desc:0 "To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first, we need to do away with old political doctrine and be ready to adopt bold, ambitious views on how our nation is to be ruled from now on."
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr:0 "국민 결속"
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr_desc:0 "This era is a strange one, with the rise of Communism, the fragile position of Democracy and the maintained Authoritarian old order. We must protect our country from outside influences by ensuring our people believe in the founding values of our country, least we are washed away by opposing views."
generic_militarism:0 "군국주의"
generic_militarism_desc:0 "Those who view the military as a necessary evil are doomed to hesitate in the face of war. We will ingrain militarism into our culture to become a people of soldiers, if not an army with a state. If one thing is certain since the Great War, it is that it might very well not have been The War To End War."
generic_military_youth:0 "유소년 군사조직"
generic_military_youth_desc:0 "Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early in a citizen's life. These core values must be learned from the most tender age, so that the next generations are ready to fight for our country."
generic_ideological_fanaticism:0 "이념적 광신"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_desc:0 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death. There is no middle ground in this ideological struggle of the great and small powers alike."
generic_liberty_ethos_kr:0 "자유의 정신"
generic_liberty_ethos_kr_desc:0 "Freedom is not just a happy happenstance, it is something that must be preserved against tyranny. The Great War and the rise of Communism has to many put this spirit in doubt, but no nation is too small to rekindle its flame in their governments and populaces and ward against those trying to extinguish it."
generic_rights_of_man:0 "인간의 권리"
generic_rights_of_man_desc:0 "The Rights Of Man is perhaps the founding act of the modern Democracy, doing away with the feudal order and ensuring equal rights for all. There have always been the odd doubts about our stance on those essential rights, and we will dispel them without ambiguity. We only stand to benefit from it."
generic_liberty_research:0 "대학 지원금"
generic_liberty_research_desc:0 "The modern University is a great achievement, allowing people of even modest origin to elevate themselves via higher learning. However, this requires us to fund university grants to allow such access to poorer but aspiring students. Let's make that move now, these future scholars will pay dividends."
generic_welfare:0 "복지 제도"
generic_welfare_desc:0 "Equality in rights and equality in education are two important milestones, but economic equality is perhaps the hardest. While we might never reach a perfect equality in this area, we can at least prop up the poorest in our country with fair welfare programs. This ought to help our consumer economy speed up, too."
generic_national_identity:0 "민족 주체성"
generic_national_identity_desc:0 "While the ideological debate is one we could get lost in for ages, we must not forget who we are at our core. We are unique, we know our history, our culture and we hope that our destiny is even more brilliant. If we have shaped a better society today, we will shape an even better country tomorrow."

### Generic Ideas ###
generic_liberty_idea:0 "자유의 정신"
generic_liberty_idea_desc:0 "Freedom is something we have pledged to preserve, and this inspires our population to support us even if they may not always agree with our policies or the state of the country in the present moment."
generic_militarism_focus:0 "군국주의"
generic_milstaff_focus:0 "국립교육원"
generic_milstaff_focus_desc:0 "Better training, a more decentralised commmand structure and encouraging innovative Military though will allow our Officer Corps to act at peak efficiency."
generic_reformsupply_focus:0 "새 보급체계"
generic_recruitment_focus:0 "모병 운동"
generic_recruitment_focus_desc:0 "A nationalistic sentiment coupled with the glorification of the Standard Soldier has lead to an influx of recruits in our military."
generic_militarism_focus_desc:0 "Our people have come to see the army as an integral part of our nation, and every conscript plays his part. This allows us to mobilise reserves, militia and other paramilitary forces in a pinch."
generic_military_youth_focus:0 "유소년 군사조직"
generic_military_youth_focus_desc:0 "From the youngest age, our citizens learn military values and integrate them as a part of their life. This obviously increases the amount of vocations for the army as they reach adulthood."
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus:0 "이념적 광신"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus_desc:0 "Our country is the centre of our ideology, and our ideology is the fabric of country. Many are ready to die for its survival when others would easily retreat to new positions."
generic_liberty_research_idea:0 "대학 지원금"
generic_liberty_research_idea_desc:0 "We are paying modest but still relatively decent university grants to ensure any aspiring student has a shot at higher education. This is bound to increase the size of our intelligentsia"
generic_welfare_idea:0 "복지 제도"
generic_welfare_idea_desc:0 "We are ensuring that the poorest in our society receive the help they need to survive, so that they do not have to fend for themselves and may work for our economy one day."

### Generic Events ###
genfocus.1.t:0 "누구에게서 수입해야 할까요?"
genfocus.1.d:0 "After our Nation's recent descision to Import arms from another country, we have been stumped on a very important question. Who will we import the Arms from? Purchasing from the Soviets would net us the largest portion of weapons, however they would be outdated for the most part. Purchasing from the British or French would grant us a sizable amount of arms, at a reasonable quality. Purchasing arms from the Germans would enable us to purchase a lower amount of higher quality weaponry. But the question remains, who shall we import from?"
genfocus.2.t:0 "최신 무기 판매"
genfocus.2.d:0 "It seems that we have recently made an Arms sale! [From.GetName] has purchased a shipment of arms from us, which is en-route to their location right now. These arms weren't in-use by our military; so this won't impact our stored arms. For the moment, we're raking in funds from this sale."
