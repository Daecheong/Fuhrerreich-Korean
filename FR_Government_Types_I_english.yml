internationalist_subtype_desc:0 "집산주의와 마르크스주의의 중도파로부터 발전한 국제사회주의, 국제주의라고 알려진 노선은 노동자들이 일단 권력을 잡는데 성공하면 영구적인 혁명을 위하여 체계적으로 되어야 하고, 계속해서 적극적으로 투쟁을 벌여야 한다고 주장하는 사회주의의 이념입니다. 대부분의 사회주의 노선은 국제적이지만, 국제주의의 능동적 움직임은 더 전투적인 성격을 띠게 했습니다. 국제주의 이념가들은 혁명을 명분으로 노동자들의 군국화를 증대시키고 노동자들의 이익과 자유를 방어할 수 있는 강력한 국가를 수립하는 것을 주창하는 것으로 알려져 있습니다. 혁명을 반대하는 반동세력을 제거하는 것은 국제주의자들의 주요 의제입니다. 혁명은 결코 멈춰서는 안되기 때문입니다."

vanguardist_subtype_desc:0 "National Collectivism is a term used to describe the collection of theories and concepts created by Vyacheslav Molotov based off of the attempted Hamburg Commune. National Collectivism emphasizes the development of socialism within the state. National Collectivist states build and implement their political base along Leninist lines, creating a revolutionary vanguard state to eventually reach a communist society. However, most power in National Collectivism is centralized around the strong state and its leader. Due to its totalitarian nature, political violence is used liberally to purge counter-revolutionary elements  Agriculture is often collectivized en masse and industry is centrally planned. Despite this, National Collectivism is widespread and sees itself as the true successor of Leninist thought, separating itself from Libertarianism completely while remaining suspicious of mainstream Leninist Socialism."
###
collectivist_subtype_desc:0 "Created in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Leninist Socialism is the mainstream socialist ideology. Named after the interpretations of Karl Marx by revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, Leninist Socialism adheres to the creation of a revolutionary vanguard and the dictatorship of the proletariat through class struggle and violent overthrow of the capitalist state. The eventual goal of Socialism is for the state functions to wither away and eventually transform society into a Marxist communist society. The Leninist Socialist political system is built around a single party state ran by the revolutionary workers party that adheres to a top-down approach towards governing known as democratic centralism, while the economic system is reliant of worker controlled regional and municipal councils known as soviets. Internationalist in tone, Leninist Socialism is often exported around the globe by its adherents and is heavily reinforced by the Leninist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."

###
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system.

###
valkist_subtype_desc:0 "Named after the Germanic symbol that German Valkists wear, Valkism is an extreme nationalist and militaristic ideology, that proposes a system where the political power is centralized under a strong leadership, that through the state controls and guides the nation to its national rebirth. Nonetheless, Valkists fundamentally defend socially progressive ideals and the leader grants liberties to the people. Valkists are characterized by adopting conceptual and aesthetical aspects from ancient, pagan, mystical and esoterical traditions, generally relevant to the nation in question. There are many schools of thought in Valkist economics, but the state supremacy and control over it is undisputed."

Typically classified as being extremely authoritarian, Social Nationalism is an extremely fringe ideology that originated in Hungary in 1932 with the foundation of the Arrow Cross party. Some trademarks of Social Nationalism is extreme economic protectionism, hyper-revanchism, ideals of racial and ethnic superiority, and a strong desire to bring together all members of an ethnicity under the same flag. Social Nationalist regimes tend to rule with an iron fist, and any attempt at liberlization of the government will almost always end in the collapse of the regime."
